## Contribution

Contribution is always welcome, even if it is just well-meaning feedback.

### Tone

- When writing documentation or comments, please write as though you are explaining something to your mum...
- Useful comments explain 'why' something happens.
- TODO comments should reference a ticket to carry out the thing TO-DO.
- 'What' code does should speak for itself by way of following community conventions
- Prefer meaningful variable and function names, etc.
- If you are strugling to hold in your head all that is happening in a function, consider splitting out behaviour.

### Testing

Coming soon... :)
